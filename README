Overview
========

StructurePipe is a high throughput (crystal) structure processing code.  It
uses PipeLib and SSLib to create pipelines through which structure data flows
allowing the same operations to be performed on many structures.  The primary
goal of StructurePipe is to act as a crystal structure prediction and
processing tool.
